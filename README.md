# AI-Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe

Here is my new project ! I am very excited to announce that I have finished it !

I will add other features (I'm trying to improve my heuristic function). But the code is working.

## How does it work ?

### Prerequisites
You need Python 3.7.x. Python 3.8 can be good too. But perhaps there will be bugs with Pygame. 
Thus you also need Pygame. 

### Play versus another human

If you want to play against another human :
Download the folder  **```Human Vs Human```** And run **```UTTT.py```** 

### Play versus an AI 

If you want to play against my AI. My AI is Minimax. 
Download the folder **```Human Vs Minimax```** And run **```UTTT.py```** 




#### Don't forget
Don't forget to keep all files and assets in the same folder.
